token curl test
To test your Humanitec API token using curl, you can make a simple API request to retrieve information about your organizations. Here's an example command:

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${HUMANITEC_TOKEN}" https://api.humanitec.io/orgs
This command will use your Humanitec API token to authenticate and retrieve a list of organizations you have access to. Make sure to replace ${HUMANITEC_TOKEN} with your actual Humanitec API token.
If the token is valid, you should receive a JSON response with information about your organizations. If the token is invalid or expired, you'll receive an error message.
This method of testing your token is mentioned in the API References documentation.
Remember to keep your API token secure and never share it publicly.
